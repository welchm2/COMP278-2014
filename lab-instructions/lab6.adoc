= Lab 6: Sequential logic

In this lab, design sequential logic circuits.

== Even/Odd number of zeroes and ones

. Answer these questions about the state machine above.
.. How many bits for state will you need?
.. How many input bits will you need?
. Then, map states to bits, and map inputs to bits.
. Write out a state-transition table.
. Convert the state-transition table into the appropriate logic expressions.
. Finally, using either the appropriate gates, or the equivalent MUX configurations, implement this as a circuit in Logisim.

== Vending machine

Since 25 cents is the final state, what happens if we get extra currency?
Or, what happens if we get foreign currency?
Feel free to transition to a "bogus" state (or states) for these purposes.
. Convert the state-transition table into the appropriate logic expressions.
. Finally, using either the appropriate gates, or the equivalent MUX configurations, implement this vending machine as a circuit in Logisim.
