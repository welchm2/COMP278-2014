= Lab 7: Assembly/Machine language programming

It's like CS1 all over again!

Use the https://github.com/lawrancej/COMP278-2014/blob/master/circuits/cpu-16bit-isa.txt[CPU ISA document for reference].

== Maximum

1. Write out source code for a function that computes the maximum of two numbers.
(Yes, I know practically every language has a `max(a,b)` function, I want you to write your own version).
2. Write out equivalent assembly code for source code.
One stipulation: the two numbers should be loaded from RAM.
Hint: the STOR instruction doesn't work. Store the result into a register. To move data from Rs to Rd, ADD Rd, Rs, R0 (R0 is constant 0).
3. Write out equivalent machine code, and test it in Logisim, using the supplied CPU in `circuits/cpu-16bit.circ`. Save the contents of RAM as lab7max.txt.

== Sum

1. Write out source code for a function that computes the sum of an array of integers. 
(Yes, I know practically every language has a sum(array) function, I want you to write your own version).
Write it with the assumption that the length is given separately from the array: `int sum(int length, int[] array);`
2. Write out equivalent assembly code for source code.
One stipulation: the array should be loaded from RAM, and the size of the array should be read first.
Hint: use the LOAD Ra instruction (opcode d in hex).
3. Write out equivalent machine code, and test it in Logisim, using the supplied CPU in `circuits/cpu-16bit.circ`. Save the contents of RAM as lab7sum.txt.

When you are done, save your work and do the following:

git commit -am "Lab 7 complete." # Record your changes locally
git push origin master           # Push your work
